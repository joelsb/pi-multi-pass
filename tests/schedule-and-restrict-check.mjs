/**
 * Regression tests for two silent-data-loss bugs in the pool editors.
 *
 * Both were found by driving the real TUI, and both were invisible to the rest
 * of this directory: pool-edit-check.mjs and project-restriction-check.mjs
 * re-implement the logic locally, so they passed while the shipped code was
 * wrong. These tests load extensions/multi-sub.ts itself.
 *
 * Bug 1 - schedule windows: input the parser could not read was discarded
 *   without a word. A "preferred" member with zero windows is ALWAYS active
 *   (getScheduledMemberState), so "09:00-18:00" produced a pool that looked
 *   scheduled and behaved unscheduled.
 *
 * Bug 2 - project restriction: the staged allow-list started empty instead of
 *   seeded from the saved config, and the editor saves on Escape as well as on
 *   [Done - save]. Opening the screen and backing out wiped the restriction and
 *   reported "Project restriction cleared. All subs available."
