# pi-multi-pass

Multi-subscription extension for [pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-coding-agent) -- use multiple OAuth accounts per provider with automatic rate-limit rotation and project-level affinity.

## Working on this fork

`~/.pi/agent/npm/node_modules/pi-multi-pass/extensions/multi-sub.ts` is a **file copy** of the published package, not a symlink to this checkout. Committing here changes nothing that pi runs until you copy it across:

```bash
bash scripts/deploy.sh          # copy over the installed extension (backs the old one up)
bash scripts/deploy.sh --check  # report drift only, exit 1 if they differ
```

Already-running pi sessions keep the old copy - extensions load per process. And `pi package update` will overwrite the deployed file with upstream, silently dropping every local fix, so re-run the script afterwards.

## Install

```bash
pi install npm:pi-multi-pass
```

Or via git:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/hjanuschka/pi-multi-pass
```

## Features

- **Multiple subscriptions**: Add extra OAuth accounts for any provider
- **Rotation pools**: Group subscriptions and auto-rotate on rate limits
- **Smart pool strategies**: `round-robin`, `quota-first`, `scheduled` (time windows), `custom` (JS script hook)
- **Fallback chains**: Define ordered cross-pool/model failover via `/pool chain`
- **Opt-in routing trace**: Record recent selection, skip, and failover decisions only when requested
- **Model presets**: Named routing shortcuts across providers (`/mp-preset coding-premium`)
- **Built-in limits checks**: Inspect subscription headroom across accounts with `/subs limits`
- **Smarter retries**: Preserve failover progress across internal replay retries
- **Project affinity**: Restrict which subs/pools/chains are used per project
- **TUI management**: `/subs`, `/pool`, and `/mp-preset` commands -- no config files needed
- **Labels**: Tag subscriptions (e.g. "work", "personal")
- **Live model catalogs**: Subscription providers mirror the base provider's
  merged model catalog (static builtin + pi.dev remote overlay from
  `models-store.json`) on every model refresh, so newly catalogued models
  (e.g. `gpt-6-astra` for Codex) reach extra accounts without a
  pi-multi-pass release

## Quick start

```
/subs add              Pick a provider, add a subscription
/login                 Authenticate the new subscription
/subs switch           Manually switch to another subscription/provider
/subs limits           Check built-in quota support (Codex + Google)
/pool create           Group subs into a rotation pool (with strategy selection)
/pool chain create     Build an ordered fallback chain across pools
/pool trace start      Start recording routing decisions for this session
/mp-preset create         Create a named routing preset across providers
/mp-preset coding-premium Activate a preset by name
```

When one account hits a rate limit during an assistant turn, multi-pass automatically switches to the next eligible target and retries.

## Commands

### `/subs` -- Subscription management

```
/subs              Open menu
/subs add          Add a new subscription
/subs remove       Remove a subscription
/subs login        Login or re-authenticate a subscription
/subs logout       Logout from a subscription
/subs switch       Manually switch to a subscription/provider now
/subs list         List subscriptions with auth status; select one for quick actions
/subs status       Detailed status (token expiry, pool membership)
/subs limits       Check built-in quota/usage support (Codex + Google)
```

### `/pool` -- Rotation pool and chain management

```
/pool              Open menu
/pool create       Create a pool (pick provider, select members)
/pool list         Show pools; select one for quick actions
/pool chain        Open chain manager
/pool toggle       Enable/disable a pool
/pool remove       Delete a pool (keeps subscriptions; prunes linked chain entries)
/pool status       Member health (logged in, rate limited, cooling down)
/pool trace        Manage the opt-in routing decision trace
/pool project      Project-level config (restrict subs, override pools/chains)
```

### `/pool trace` -- Opt-in routing decisions

Tracing is disabled by default and stores nothing until explicitly started. Entries
are kept only in memory for the current pi session, with the newest 100 retained.
Prompt contents are not recorded.

```
/pool trace start   Clear old entries and begin recording
/pool trace show    Inspect selections, skipped candidates, and failovers
/pool trace status  Show whether recording is active
/pool trace stop    Stop recording while retaining captured entries
/pool trace clear   Delete captured entries
```

### `/pool chain` -- Ordered fallback chain management

```
/pool chain             Open chain manager
/pool chain create      Create a chain
/pool chain list        Show all chains
/pool chain toggle      Enable/disable a chain
/pool chain remove      Delete a chain
/pool chain status      Inspect chain entries and validity
```

### `/mp-preset` -- Model presets (named routing)

```
/mp-preset                 Open menu
/mp-preset activate        Switch to a preset's best available entry
/mp-preset <name>          Activate a preset by name directly
/mp-preset create          Create a new preset
/mp-preset list            Show all presets
/mp-preset toggle          Enable/disable a preset
/mp-preset remove          Delete a preset
```

## Project-level configuration

Use `/pool project` to configure per-project subscription affinity. This creates `.pi/multi-pass.json` in your project directory.

When `allowedSubs` is set, multi-pass now treats it as an exact allow-list for this project: active routing, pool membership, and chain traversal are all constrained to those provider names.

### Use case: separate work and personal accounts

```
# Global: you have 3 Codex accounts
/subs add   -> openai-codex-2 (label: work)
/subs add   -> openai-codex-3 (label: personal)

# Corp project: restrict to team accounts only
cd ~/work/corp-project
/pool project -> restrict -> select openai-codex-2 only

# Side project: allow everything (no restriction)
cd ~/side-project
# No .pi/multi-pass.json needed -- uses all global subs
```

### What project config can do

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Restrict subs** | Only allow specific provider names in this project (for example `openai-codex-2` or `openai-codex`) |
| **Override pools** | Use different pools than global (or disable some) |
| **Override chains** | Use different fallback chains than global |
| **Clear** | Remove project config, fall back to global |
| **Info** | Show effective config (which pools/chains/subs are active) |

### Project config file

`.pi/multi-pass.json`:

```json
{
  "allowedSubs": ["openai-codex-2", "anthropic-2"],
  "pools": [
    {
      "name": "work-codex",
      "baseProvider": "openai-codex",
      "members": ["openai-codex-2"],
      "enabled": true
    }
  ],
  "chains": [
    {
      "name": "work-fallback",
      "enabled": true,
      "entries": [
        { "pool": "work-codex", "model": "gpt-5-mini", "enabled": true }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

- `allowedSubs`: whitelist of exact provider names. If set, only those exact providers are available in this project. Omit to allow all.
- `pools`: if set, replaces global pools for this project. Omit to inherit global pools.
- `chains`: if set, replaces global chains for this project. Omit to inherit global chains.

## How pools work

1. You're using `openai-codex` and hit a rate limit
2. Multi-pass detects the error, marks `openai-codex` as exhausted
3. Switches to `openai-codex-2` (same model ID, different account)
4. Retries your last prompt automatically
5. After a 5-minute cooldown, `openai-codex` becomes available again

### Pool selection strategy

Each pool has a `strategy` that controls how the next member is chosen on failover:

| Strategy | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `round-robin` | Rotate sequentially through members (default) |
| `quota-first` | Query built-in quota checkers (Anthropic, Codex) and prefer the member whose weekly quota is worth most per hour before it resets, at session start and on failover |
| `scheduled` | Use per-member time windows and priority roles |
| `custom` | Delegate to a user-provided JS selector script |

Set the strategy during pool creation (`/pool create`) or change it later via `/pool list` -> select pool -> `strategy`.

All strategies fall back to round-robin when their specific data is unavailable.

#### `quota-first`

You have 2 Claude accounts in a pool. Account A has 43% of its week left, resetting in 4 days. Account B has 53% left, resetting in 20 hours. Whatever B does not spend in those 20 hours is lost, so `quota-first` starts the session on B, and on failover picks the member with the highest weekly % left per hour until reset, instead of the next one in rotation order.

A member with under 10% of its 5-hour window or under 5% of its week left is skipped. When no member qualifies, the one with the most remaining quota wins on failover and the session stays where it is at start. The pick at session start costs one usage call per pool member (5 second timeout, any failure keeps the current model). It is made once: switching accounts mid-session loses the prompt cache. The chain order (pool to pool) never changes, only the order inside a pool.

Uses the same built-in quota checkers as `/subs limits` (currently Anthropic and Codex). Anthropic usage needs a Claude subscription (OAuth) login, not an API key.

```json
{
  "name": "codex-pool",
  "baseProvider": "openai-codex",
  "members": ["openai-codex", "openai-codex-2", "openai-codex-3"],
  "enabled": true,
  "strategy": "quota-first"
}
```

#### `scheduled`

Assign each member a role and optional time windows:

- **preferred**: only used during its active windows. When multiple preferred members are active, the one whose window ends soonest goes first (burn that quota before the window closes).
- **default** (no role): always available, used after preferred members.
- **overflow**: last resort, used when preferred and default members are exhausted.

```json
{
  "name": "codex-pool",
  "baseProvider": "openai-codex",
  "members": ["openai-codex", "openai-codex-2", "openai-codex-3"],
  "enabled": true,
  "strategy": "scheduled",
  "memberSchedule": {
    "openai-codex": {
      "role": "preferred",
      "windows": [{ "hours": [9, 17], "days": ["mon", "tue", "wed", "thu", "fri"] }]
    },
    "openai-codex-2": {
      "role": "preferred",
      "windows": [{ "hours": [17, 9] }]
    },
    "openai-codex-3": {
      "role": "overflow"
    }
  }
}
```

Window format:
- `hours`: `[start, end)` in 24h local time. Wraps midnight when start > end (e.g. `[22, 6]` = 22:00-05:59).
- `days`: array of `"mon"`, `"tue"`, ..., `"sun"`. Omit for every day.
- `dateRange`: `{ "from": "2025-06-01", "to": "2025-06-30" }` for temporary windows.

During pool creation or via the `strategy` quick action, you can configure schedules interactively with human-friendly input like `9-17 mon-fri`.

#### `custom`

Point to a JS script that decides which member to try first. The script receives full context and returns the preferred provider name (or an ordered array).

```json
{
  "name": "codex-pool",
  "baseProvider": "openai-codex",
  "members": ["openai-codex", "openai-codex-2", "openai-codex-3"],
  "enabled": true,
  "strategy": "custom",
  "selectorScript": "selectors/my-codex-selector.js"
}
```

Script paths are resolved relative to `~/.pi/agent/`. Absolute paths and `~/` paths also work.

**Selector script interface:**

```js
// ~/.pi/agent/selectors/my-codex-selector.js
module.exports = async function select(ctx) {
  // ctx.members:         string[]  -- available (non-exhausted, authenticated) members
  // ctx.currentProvider: string    -- the provider that just hit a rate limit
  // ctx.modelId:         string    -- the model ID being used
  // ctx.pool:            object    -- { name, baseProvider, members }
  // ctx.timestamp:       number    -- current Unix timestamp (ms)
  // ctx.hour:            number    -- current hour (0-23, local time)
  // ctx.day:             string    -- current day of week ("mon".."sun")
  // ctx.prompt:          string?   -- last user prompt, if available
  //
  // Return: string (provider name), string[] (ordered preference), or undefined (fall back)

  // Example: prefer a specific account during business hours
  if (ctx.hour >= 9 && ctx.hour < 17) {
    return ctx.members.find(m => m === "openai-codex-2");
  }
  return ctx.members[0];
};
```

If the script throws, returns an invalid provider name, or the file is missing, the pool falls back to round-robin.

## How chains work

1. You define an ordered chain of pool/model entries (for example `primary -> backup -> solo`)
2. If the current pool has no eligible members, multi-pass continues forward in the chain
3. It skips disabled or invalid entries and reports why in warnings
4. During retry replays for the same prompt, it preserves cascade state and avoids re-trying already attempted providers
5. Session status shows the active chain start entry: `chain:<name> | starts <pool> -> <model>`

## Retry the same account before rotating away from it

A single refusal is not proof an account is finished. Measured on one session, one model, one account, four minutes apart: `ok`, `ok`, **refused**, `ok`. Rotating on that one refusal moved a healthy account aside, published the eviction to every other pi process for five minutes, and pushed everything onto the last provider until it capped for real.

So a refusal now **replays the prompt on the same account** first, and only rotates once the attempts are spent:

```
[pool:anthropic] anthropic-2 refused this request; retrying the same account in 2s (attempt 1 of 3) before rotating
```

| Variable | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MULTI_PASS_RETRY_IN_PLACE_ATTEMPTS` | `3` | tries on the same account before rotating; `0` restores rotate-on-first-error |
| `MULTI_PASS_RETRY_IN_PLACE_MS` | `2000` | delay before each try; `0` also disables |

Two things worth knowing:

- **A 429 still rotates immediately.** The retry is gated on the same predicate as the failover replay, so it only applies to errors pi did *not* already retry internally. By the time a 429 reaches this extension, pi has exhausted its own attempts.
- **The cost against a genuinely dead account is bounded and real**: `attempts x delay` before moving on, so `3 x 2s` is 6 seconds and three wasted requests per account. Lower both if you would rather a dead cascade fail fast.

Nothing is written to the shared exhaustion ledger during in-place retries - that is the whole point. A blip must not evict a working account for every other process on the machine.

## Tiers: keeping your model's class across a chain hop

A chain entry names one model, so before tiers every hop landed on that model no matter what the session was running. A cheap recon session got promoted to a flagship model, and a flagship session could be quietly demoted mid-task. Neither is an error; you find out from the bill or from a suddenly worse answer.

Add an optional `tiers` table to `~/.pi/agent/multi-pass.json` and the hop keeps the **class** of model you were on:

```json
"tiers": [
  { "name": "flagship", "models": { "anthropic": "claude-opus-5",    "openai-codex": "gpt-5.6-sol"  } },
  { "name": "mid",      "models": { "anthropic": "claude-sonnet-5",  "openai-codex": "gpt-5.5"      } },
  { "name": "cheap",    "models": { "anthropic": "claude-haiku-4-5", "openai-codex": "gpt-5.4-mini" } }
]
```

A `claude-sonnet-5` session whose anthropic pool dries up now lands on `gpt-5.5`, and the status line says which decided it:

```
advancing to chain all#2; active openai-codex (gpt-5.5) [tier: mid]
advancing to chain all#2; active openai-codex (gpt-5.6-sol) [chain default]
```

Rules worth knowing:

- **Optional.** No `tiers` key means the old behaviour, byte for byte, including the status strings.
- **Keyed by base provider, not by account.** Write `anthropic`, not `anthropic-2`: a second account on the same subscription shares one catalogue, and by the time a cascade hops it has usually rotated within the pool already.
- **Any gap falls back to the chain entry's model** - a model in no tier, a tier that names nothing for the target provider, or a tier pointing at a model that provider does not serve. That last check matters: an unusable model would otherwise abort the whole cascade.
- **A model in two tiers is a config error**; the first match wins, deterministically.
- **Same-pool rotation is untouched.** It always kept your model.
- **Chains only.** Presets are a separate ordered route list and are not tier-mapped.
- Do not try to infer tiers from model names. `-mini`, `-opus` and `sol` are vendor marketing and they change; the table is explicit on purpose.

## Model presets

Presets are named routing shortcuts that map to an ordered list of provider+model entries across different providers. Think of them as intent-based routing: `coding-premium`, `coding-budget`, `fastest`, etc.

### Commands

```
/mp-preset              Open menu
/mp-preset activate     Switch to a preset's best available entry
/mp-preset <name>       Activate a preset by name directly
/mp-preset create       Create a new preset
/mp-preset list         Show all presets
/mp-preset toggle       Enable/disable a preset
/mp-preset remove       Delete a preset
```

### Example

```
/mp-preset create
  Name: coding-premium
  Entries:
    1. anthropic / claude-sonnet-4-20250514
    2. openai-codex / o3
    3. google-gemini-cli / gemini-2.5-pro

/mp-preset coding-premium
  -> Tries anthropic first. If not logged in, tries openai-codex. Then gemini.
```

### Config

Presets are stored in `~/.pi/agent/multi-pass.json`:

```json
{
  "presets": [
    {
      "name": "coding-premium",
      "enabled": true,
      "entries": [
        { "provider": "anthropic", "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514", "enabled": true },
        { "provider": "openai-codex", "model": "o3", "enabled": true },
        { "provider": "google-gemini-cli", "model": "gemini-2.5-pro", "enabled": true }
      ]
    },
    {
      "name": "coding-budget",
      "enabled": true,
      "entries": [
        { "provider": "openai-codex", "model": "gpt-4.1-mini", "enabled": true },
        { "provider": "google-gemini-cli", "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", "enabled": true }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Presets work with pools: if an entry's provider belongs to a pool, rate-limit failover still rotates within that pool before trying the next preset entry.

## Supported providers

| Provider key | Service |
|---|---|
| `anthropic` | Claude Pro/Max |
| `openai-codex` | ChatGPT Plus/Pro (Codex) |
| `github-copilot` | GitHub Copilot |
| `google-gemini-cli` | Google Cloud Code Assist |
| `google-antigravity` | Antigravity |

## Built-in limits support

`/subs limits` uses a provider-specific checker registry.

Currently implemented:

- `openai-codex`: fetches ChatGPT/Codex usage from `https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage` (or `CHATGPT_BASE_URL`), then summarizes the 5-hour and 7-day subscription windows for the base account and any configured extra Codex subscriptions.
- `google-gemini-cli`: refreshes the saved Google OAuth session when needed, then queries `https://cloudcode-pa.googleapis.com/v1internal:retrieveUserQuota` and summarizes the returned Gemini quota buckets by their bottleneck family (for example `Pro` or `Flash`).
- `google-antigravity`: refreshes the saved Antigravity OAuth session when needed, then queries `v1internal:fetchAvailableModels` on the Google Cloud Code Assist endpoints with Antigravity-style headers and summarizes the returned model-level bottleneck.

Google quota is not a single flat subscription bucket, so the details view shows one line per returned Gemini family or Antigravity model with its remaining headroom and reset time.

`/subs limits` is an on-demand snapshot. It helps you see which account looks healthiest right now. Automatic switching still happens when the active provider returns a rate-limit-style runtime error and that provider belongs to an enabled pool or chain.

When a pool uses the `quota-first` strategy, the same quota checkers are used automatically at session start and during failover to pick the member whose weekly quota expires soonest instead of just round-robin.

When a project defines `.pi/multi-pass.json` with `allowedSubs`, `/subs limits` only shows accounts allowed in that project.

Future providers can add another checker without changing the `/subs` command surface.

## Environment variable (optional)

```bash
export MULTI_SUB="openai-codex:2,anthropic:1"
```

Env entries merge with saved config.
